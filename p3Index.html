<h2>A Brief Look at Two Classical Composers </h2>


<div style="float:left; width: 55%">
  <p> The classical era for music (c. 1730â€“1820) is very a rich historical period. It had many
    great heros who pushed the music further and further. Some houshold names worth mentioning are
     Joseph Hayden, Franz Schubert, Johann Christian Bach, Ludwig Van Beethoven, Wolfgang
      Amadeus Mozart. This site will be focusing only on the last two of these great composers.
  </p>

<p> The way this site is linned up is that first you'll be introduced
  to a page for each of the two composers. The page will conatin quintessential info.
  Next you'll face a mild quiz on what you've learned. Then you'll get results to said quiz.
  Lastly, you'll be able to play around on a virtual keyboard to some of your favorite classical tunes.
